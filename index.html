                    Developed ROS/C++ code using OOP to make the explorer turtlebot move to the locations of various aruco markers, rotate until it detects the marker and store and broadcast its fiducial ID and transform w.r.t. map frame to parameter server. And come back home after reading
                    all aruco markers (Searching for the victims) and make the follower turtlebot go to the marker locations broadcasted by the explorer with 0.4 mts. tolerance in increasing order of fiducial ID and then come back home (Saving the victims).
