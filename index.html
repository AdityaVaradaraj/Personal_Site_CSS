                <h3>Mechatronics</h3>
                <p>
                    Having done my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, I had the golden opportunity to learn about concepts/working of Mechatronics, MEMS(Micro Electromechanical Systems) and about their modelling and simulation.
                    This gave me an opportunity to work hands-on on hydraulic, pneumatic and electro-pneumatic systems.
                    These courses had assignments to teach us softwares like Festo FluidSim, COMSOL and 20Sim.
                    Apart from academics, I learnt about Arduino and RPi programming through being a part of 
                    the Tronix Comittee of our tech-fest Engineer and also got to use the knowledge obtained 
                    in my final year Major Project.

                <h3>Design and Development of a Skin Elasticity Measuring Device</h3>
                <p>
                    My final year Major project under the guidance of Dr. Navin Karanth P., was in the field of Mechatronics.<br>
                    <strong>Aim:</strong> To design and develop a low-cost extension-method based prototype to measure human skin elasticity.<br>
                    <strong>Importance:</strong> Diseases like Diabetes and Systemic Sclerosis cause cutaneous manifestations over a period of time, and hence, a change in Skin elasticity. 
                    The detection of this change in skin elasticity can help in speeding up the early stage pre-diagnosis of Diabetes.<br>
                    <strong>Validation:</strong> The developed prototype was tested and validated on Skin Phantoms like Silicone Rubber and Latex Rubber. The validation was done w.r.t. the elasticity values of samples measured by UTM (Universal Testing Machine)

                <h3>Simulating a UR-5 Manipulator using Forward Kinematics</h3>
                <p>
                    During my 8 weeks internship at Bajaj Auto Ltd. Robotics dept., one of the projects I had done was this one. 
                    I wrote a python code to simulate the movements of the UR-5 manipulator in order to get a better understanding of what joint angles lead to what end-effector positions.
                    The concepts used included Forward Kinematics, D-H Parameters and Matrix Theory. 
                    I used matplotlib library for 3D simulation by plotting.
                    Trackbars were provided to change the joint angles and view the corresponding configuration of the UR-5.

                <h3>Remotely controlling UR5 movements using Google Sheets API</h3>
                <p>
                    During my 8 weeks internship at Bajaj Auto Ltd. Robotics dept., I also worked on an Google Sheets based IoT project along with my fellow intern. 
                    We used 2 seperate codes on 2 seperate laptops. One was a client-side code, and another was a host-side code. 
                    The client-side code was a Kivy App with buttons for X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z-, Rx+, Rx-, Ry+, Ry-, Rz+ and Rz-. 
                    When the client clicks on a button in the app, the corresponding cell in the Google sheet gets updated to value of 1.
                    The host-side code reads the google sheet and if a cell has value 1, it commands the robot via Ethernet communication to move accordingly depending on whether that cell corresponds to X+ or X- or .... or Rz-. 
                    After robot has moved to the position, it resets the value in that cell of the google sheet back to 0.
                    So, a person sitting in a remote location with access to internet can command the robot to move via the app, and the robot can move accordingly in the plant in which the robot is installed. 
                    This is especially helpful while programming of newly installed robots in other plants. Usually, a person from the main plant has to go to other plants of the company to install the robot and program or reprogram it.
                    By our IoT project, they would be able to teach the robot waypoints sitting at the main plant itself.

                <h3>Virtual Table Tennis</h3>
                <p>
                    During my 8 weeks internship at Bajaj Auto Ltd. Robotics dept., I also worked on a Computer Vision based project along with my fellow intern.
                    In this project, we wrote a code to continuously detect the real table tennis bat and whenever the image of the real bat captured in the live video touches the virtual ball which is moving around the screen,
                    it bounces off and changes its path as if you were actually playing TT with a real ball.
                    We also added sound effects for more fun.
                    This project demonstrates how real objects can communicate with virtual objects via Computer Vision.
